# cljgae-template

A Leiningen template for creating Google App Engine apps in Clojure using the GAE Java SDK (supports 11 and 17 runtimes with bundled services)

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.clojars.nickbauman/cljgae-template.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.clojars.nickbauman/cljgae-template)

Google App Engine is the first "Serverless" web PaaS the world has ever seen, launched as an opinionated, fully managed service 16 years ago. 
Designed to scale out-of-the-box, with many more features teams would take years to assemble. This template is meant to get you started on 
appengine with Clojure quickly.

## Release 1.0.3.1

Leiningen Clojars dependency:

[org.clojars.nickbauman/cljgae-template "1.0.3.1"]

## Template Installation

To use this template locally, installing it into your library cache - ~/.m2/repository/. 

From the root of the template project, run the following command:

```shell
lein install
````

## Usage

    lein new cljgae-template <project name> <project organization ID> <availability zone> <billing-account> <java-runtime>

Example:

    lein new cljgae-template a4d07e6a3-f194-07d0-8a4b-1695 456350996759 us-central 4D2-1D73A5-012F81-6E5 17

Creates a new appengine project on disk under dir <project name> that should run
on the Gen2 OSS Runtimes, (Java11/17 with bundled services). It has a few routes 
with corresponding tests which show the usage of a few appengine APIs such as 

* Google Cloud Storage (via file upload test example)
* The datastore, including a Clojure DSL for querying the datastore (see 
  `db.clj` test for examples)
* The App Identity Service API (via "/" route)
* Asyncronous task queues / AKA appengine"push queues" (via a JSON request of 
  a "large" list of data points)
* User services with user state examples

With unit tests for each. All examples also run on the dev appserver.

## Datastore query language

A Clojure DSL has been developed inspired by the Python NDB library (with an 
emphasis on Clojure's more functional idiom.) Queries return a lazy sequence.

### Examples

```clojure
(defentity BasicEntity [content saved-time repeated-value])

(defentity AnotherEntity [content saved-time int-value])

(let [entity (save! (create-AnotherEntity "Some content woo" (t/date-time 1980 3 5) 6))
      entity2 (save! (create-AnotherEntity "Other content" (t/date-time 1984 10 12) 91))
      entity3 (save! (create-AnotherEntity "More interesting content" (t/date-time 1984 10 12) 17))
                                        ; repeated properties
      root-entity (save! (create-BasicEntity "basic entity content" (t/date-time 2015 6 8) [1 2 3])) 
      child-entity1 (save! (create-AnotherEntity "child one content" (t/date-time 2016 12 10) 33) (gae-key root-entity))
      child-entity2 (save! (create-AnotherEntity "child two content" (t/date-time 2016 12 10) 44) (gae-key root-entity))]   
                                        ; query all
  (query-AnotherEntity [])
                                        ; equality
  (query-AnotherEntity [:content = "Some content woo"])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:content = "Blearg not found"])
                                        ; not equal
  (query-AnotherEntity [:content != "Not found"])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:content != "Other content"])
                                        ; greater-than and less-than
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value < 7])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value < 5])
                                        ; time: before and after
  (query-AnotherEntity [:saved-time > (.toDate (t/date-time 1979 3 5))])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:saved-time < (.toDate (t/date-time 1979 3 5))])
                                        ; "and" compound queries
  (query-AnotherEntity [:and [:content = "Some content woo"] [:int-value > 5]])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:and [:int-value > 5] [:int-value <= 17]])
                                        ; "or" compound queries
  (query-AnotherEntity [:or [:content = "Some content woo"] [:int-value < 5]])
  (query-AnotherEntity [:or [:content = "Some content woo"] [:int-value > 5]])
                                        ; compound queries with nested compound predicates
  (query-AnotherEntity [:or [:content = "Other content"] 
                        [:and [:saved-time < (.toDate (t/date-time 1983 3 5))] [:int-value = 6]]])
                                        ; keys-only support
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value < 7] [:keys-only true])
                                        ; order-by support
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value > 0] [:order-by :int-value :desc])
                                        ; keys only and order-by support together 
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value > 0] [:keys-only true :order-by :int-value :desc])
                                        ; support multiple sort orders (with keys-only, too)
  (query-AnotherEntity [:saved-time > 0] [:order-by :saved-time :desc :int-value :asc :keys-only true])
                                        ; parents can find their children
  (query-AnotherEntity [] [:ancestor-key (gae-key root-entity)])
                                        ; ancestors that work with predicates
  (query-AnotherEntity [:int-value > 33] [:ancestor-key (gae-key root-entity)])
                                        ; ancestors that work with keys-only support
  (query-AnotherEntity [] [:keys-only true :ancestor-key (gae-key root-entity)])
  (query-AnotherEntity [] [:ancestor-key (gae-key root-entity) :keys-only true])
                                        ; ancestors that work with order-by
  (query-AnotherEntity [] [:ancestor-key (gae-key root-entity) :order-by :int-value :desc])
                                        ; transactions
  (with-transaction
     (save! (create-AnotherEntity "Content information" (t/date-time 1984 10 12) 201)))
                                        ; Cross-group transactions
  (with-xg-transaction
     (save! (create-AnotherEntity "Content information" (t/date-time 1984 10 12) 6001))
     (save! (create-AnotherEntity "More content information" (t/date-time 1984 10 12) 6002))))
```

### Validation

Validation of datastore entity models is optional. Adding validation involves putting a vector of keys that match your 
model properties followed by a fully qualified function property. For example:

```clojure 
(ns gaeclj.example.valid
  (:require [gaeclj.ds :refer [defentity]]))

(defentity CostStrategy
           [uuid
            create-date
            cost-uuid
            strategy-description
            ordered-member-uuids
            ordered-percentages]
           [:uuid                 gaeclj.valid/valid-uuid?
            :create-date          gaeclj.valid/long?
            :cost-uuid            gaeclj.valid/valid-uuid?
            :strategy-description gaeclj.valid/string-or-nil?
            :ordered-member-uuids gaeclj.valid/repeated-uuid?
            :ordered-amounts      gaeclj.valid/repeated-longs?])
```

Creating a CostStrategy like this

```clojure
(create-CostStrategy "8e5625f8-60ec-11ea-a1ec-a45e60d5bfab"
                                   (.getMillis (t/date-time 1999 12 31))
                                   (str (uuid/v1))
                                   "even distribution"
                                   [(str (uuid/v1)) (str (uuid/v1))]
                                   ["foo" "bar"]) ; not valid
```
 
... would cause a `RuntimeException` citing the two properties:

```text
java.lang.RuntimeException: (create-CostStrategy ...) failed validation for props :ordered-amounts
```

## Future directions

* Postgres dialect
* Add support for projections
* More comprehensive examples of task queues
* More comprehensive use of cloud storage
* Examples of other commonly used GAE apis
